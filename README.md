## Requirements

vscode > 1.81.0

## Future Ideas
- Add [programmatic language features](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features) like hovers, code completion proposals, jump to definition, or auto-formatting
- Add [semantic highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide) for functions that work with CALL
- Add [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/snippet-guide)
- Verify the actual minimum required version of VS Code. `"vscode": "^1.81.0"` was the default template option.
